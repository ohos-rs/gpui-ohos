# Fast core and rendering

The optional `fast` Cargo feature selects the unmodified crates.io
`gpui-fast 0.1.13` release. The default build uses `gpui-pre 0.3.11`.
The Fast release itself uses GPUI Pre support crates from snapshot 0.3.11.
No core patch, Git dependency, or environment-variable fallback is required.

```toml
[dependencies]
gpui-fast = { package = "gpui-fast", version = "=0.1.13", default-features = false }
gpui-ohos = { version = "0.0.1-beta.0", features = ["fast"] }
```

This feature is currently available in this source branch; the published
`gpui-ohos 0.0.1-beta.0` package does not yet contain it. Use a local checkout
or a source override until a backend release includes the feature.

Every crate exchanging GPUI values must select the same core: the application,
OHOS backend, GPUI Kit, router, and optional diagnostics. GPUI Kit exposes
`gpui-fast`; router 0.7.0 requires a backend-selection patch. Enabling only the
platform feature while the application remains on GPUI Pre yields incompatible
types. An application can keep Pre as its default and select Fast with:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "fast")]
extern crate gpui_fast as gpui;
```

## Scene support

The OHOS WGPU renderer understands Fast's two additional scene formats:

- Scroll-layer sprites select per-window tile textures rather than the image
  atlas. Dirty generations invalidate affected tiles; cached tiles are reused
  while scrolling. The cache has a 64 MiB budget, evicts inactive tiles, and is
  reset with the renderer on resize or native-surface recreation.
- Rounded overflow groups draw their children in order with analytic padding-
  edge clip stacks. Nested groups, unequal radii, and paths use the same clip
  coverage. Rasterized path batches keep separate scene ranges.

The implementation adapts the official `gpui-fast-wgpu 0.1.13` frame graph,
clip protocol, and tile cache to the OHOS vertex-buffer renderer. It retains
OHOS native-surface handles, GLES adapter corrections, shared pipeline caches,
existing sprite atlases, and registered image-alpha/sampling flags. This does
not add a dependency on the desktop WGPU platform or modify gpui-fast.
Source attribution and the Apache license are in `src/ohos/fast/`.
The exact Fast version is pinned because these scene formats are private.

## Validation

Cross-compile both selections with the OHOS Rust toolchain:

```sh
ohrs cargo --disable-target -- check --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos
ohrs cargo --disable-target -- clippy --release --target aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos --features fast -- -D warnings
```

The host GPU harness compiles the production renderer, shader, atlas and frame
recording modules without OHOS N-API. It compares direct and tiled pixels for
quads, images, glyphs and paths; verifies cache invalidation/eviction; and draws
real GPUI rounded-overflow elements, including rounded clips inside tiles.
A working Metal or Vulkan adapter is needed for the pixel tests.

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path tests/renderer/Cargo.toml
```

Native-surface lifetime and GLES behavior must also be checked on an OHOS
application. In NearSend, build the complete application with `--features fast`.
